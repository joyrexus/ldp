Transcription
=============


Home Visits
-----------

Over a period of 9 months (March to Dec 2011) the Research Assistants transcribed 
103 home visit videos:

* 39 transcripts of normally developing subjects

  * 18 at visit 11
  * 18 at visit 12

* 64 transcripts of brain-injured subjects (up to visit 9)

The 39 P2 transcripts mentioned above are for the same set of 18 subjects at
both visits (11 and 12). The plan is to eventually add morphosyntactic
annotation to these transcripts.

.. admonition:: IDs for the subset of 18 normally developing subjects

    24, 29, 33, 37, 42, 43, 44, 48, 50, 62, 74, 77, 78, 84, 88, 92, 103, 105

The remaining 194 home visits to transcribe include:

* 67 visits of normally developing subjects (at visits 11 and 12)
* 7 visits of brain-injured subjects (up to visit 9)
* 120 visits of brain-injured subjects (after visit 9)


School Visits
-------------

Of the normally developing subjects, all Kindergaten visits have been
transcribed.
  


Annotation
==========


Gesture
-------

Gesture-speech annotation is currently being applied to the recently completed
transcripts of brain-injured (Project 3) subjects.  The plan is to annotate
all transcripts of home visits up to session 9.  There are no current plans to
annotate transcripts for visits 10 through 12.


Morphosyntax
------------

As mentioned in the transcription section above, the recently completed
transcripts for a select set of 18 normally developing (Project 2) subjects at 
visits 11 and 12 are scheduled to be annotated for part-of-speech and syntax.
