Overview
========

This study examines the use of "decontextualized language" in the early home
environment of both typically-developing children and children with early brain
injury. 

.. admonition:: What is decontextualized language?

    Decontextualized ("dxt") language is defined as language that is 
    removed from the here-and-now. Examples of this kind of decontextualized 
    language use are evident in early conversations between parents and 
    children, particularly in uses of extended discourse such as explanations, 
    narratives and pretend play.

We examined 5 types of decontextualized utterances: 

* narrative
* definition
* pretend 
* explanation 
* book-reading
  
We also examined a number of lexical measures for dxt utterances:

* word types
* word tokens
* MLU (mean length of utterance)
* MSW (mean number of speakers per word)

.. admonition:: MSW (Mean Speakers per Word)

    To make clear just what this means we first need to explain what we mean 
    by a word's "speaker count".

    For any given word, say "dog", we can check our canonical corpus of 
    transcripts to see how many many kids (or parents) said this word at 
    least once in the course of a visit. So let's say that the child 
    subject **A** said "dog" at two visits. And let's say that child 
    subject **B** said "dog" at three visits. If these two kids happened to 
    be the only subjects that used the word "dog" in the course of the first 
    ten visits, the child speaker count for "dog" would be five (2 for **A** 
    and 3 for **B**).  That is, a "speaker count" tells you how many speakers 
    used a particular word at least once in the course of a visit during the 
    first ten visits.

    So, when looking at a given speaker's utterances for a particular 
    transcript, we can get the "speaker counts" for each word and then 
    take the average. This average we call the "mean speakers per word".

No specific coding template was used for this study.  Rather, annotaters simply 
addded two columns (*mother_dxt* and *child_dxt*) to copies of the original 
transcript.
