Overview
========

In this line of research, we examine parental talk about letters and print related
concepts during early home visits. We are also interested in examining whether early
literacy input is related to children’s later decoding outcomes.  We examine if the 
effect of literacy input is over and above factors such as parent socio-economic-status 
or overall amount of input. We currently are done annotating transcripts from sessions 
5, 8, and 10 (where the subjects were ~ 30, 42, 50 months respectively) of the home 
visits for the P2 (normally developing) parents and children.


Status
======

Ece is doing an analysis and write-up of the findings at session 5 (30 month subjects).


Papers
======

In progress.


Archive

The data files and other documents associated with this study can be found in Ece's working directory on the LDP file server (*Analord*) in the **Groups** volume::

    afp://analord.spc.uchicago.edu/Groups/Grads/Ece/Reading/Literacy

We'll abbreviate this server/path location as ``$STUDY``.

The annotated transcripts for this study can be found in ``$STUDY/FinalTranscripts``.

.. note::

    Ece notes that Rebecca Treiman's group did some additional annotation on
    the transcripts and will try to obtain those transcripts as well.
