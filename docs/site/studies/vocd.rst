Overview
========

Lexical richness (or vocabulary diversity) has been measured in many ways, but
all of these suffer from two major weaknesses. First, most words are very low
in their probability of occurrence, such that estimates of word frequency and
lexicon size depend systematically on sample size. Second, speakers do not
sample words at random when speaking, but rather according to discourse
context, topic, syntactic, and other constraints--that is, frequency is an
inaccurate indicator of most words' likelihood of occurrence. We are seeking
improved measures of lexical richness through a combination of statistical
modeling techniques that deal with the first problem, and simulations based on
the speech transcripts that help ameliorate the second problem. We are
exploring the consequences of this approach (and the problems that led us to
develop this approach) for the interpretation and use of lexical richness
measures in research. Of greater interest, we will be describing the trajectory
of lexical richness across caregiver and child speech and over the time course
of the spontaneous speech samples (ultimately, 14-58 months).
