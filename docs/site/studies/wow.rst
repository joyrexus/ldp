Overview
========

We are currently preparing to publish the set of words used by caregivers
online as a resource for other researchers. This will take the form of a
searchable database that returns word frequencies (normalized across time), the
numbers of caregivers and children using the words, and related measures over
the time course of the study. We also aim to describe this "world of words"
according to which words (and how many) are most/least available to children in
input, which words appear with increasing vs. decreasing frequency over time,
and which words "diffuse" quickly through the sample of children.
