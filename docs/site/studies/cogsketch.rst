Overview
========

In this line of research, we are interested in children’s writing skills and
how different stages of writing (planning versus motor execution) are influenced 
by different word properties: such as frequency. We asked both P2 (normally developing)
and P3 (brain-injured) children to write single words on CogSketch tablets.


Status
======

Data collection stage (as of July 2012).
