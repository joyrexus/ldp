Overview
========

In this study we are interested in early predictors of children's reading
comprehension.  We aim to examine the frequency and the nature of book-reading 
input.  We're going to look at early parent-child book reading interactions and 
their relations to later child language and reading outcomes.

With respect to child measures, we will examine how children's early oral 
language, vocabulary and syntactic growth, relates to their reading comprehension 
growth during early school ages. We will also examine how early parental input 
relates the developmental trajectory of children's reading comprehension skills. 
In addition, we aim to compare the relation between early oral language measures 
to reading comprehension versus decoding.

In an attempt to characterize the nature of the input, we focus on 4 kinds of 
utterances parents and children produce during book-reading interactions: 

* describing the picture
* reading the text
* extending the topic
* focusing on the print
  
We examine how the frequency and the nature of these interactions relate to later 
reading outcomes, both decoding and reading comprehension. We examine if book-reading 
contributes to later outcomes over and above factors such as parent SES, overall 
parental talk, child language etc. We focus on book-reading interactions at visits 1, 
2, 4, 5, 7 and 8.
