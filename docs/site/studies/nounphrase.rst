Overview
========

We are investigating the development of noun phrases in speech and
speech+gesture. In particular, we are interested in whether pointing
gestures used with "bare nouns" precede and predict the emergence of noun
phrases where nouns are preceded by determiners or other parts of speech
(adjectives, possessives, etc.).  Little is known about the way in which
children begin to build complexity around nouns. Our study will allow us to
characterize the emergence of verbal complexity surrounding nouns and to
investigate the role gesture may play in providing specificity (e.g. this,
that, the) to spoken nouns before the same specificity is produced in
speech.


Dataset
=======

The dataset we're using is based on a subset of transcripts that have had the
child utterances annotated for part-of-speech and syntax (by Max). The plan is to add more transcripts to the dataset, but we're currently using the transcripts of thirteen subjects over the first five sessions (14m to 30m).


Analysis
========

Here we'll describe how we analyzed the dataset described above.


Reports
=======

We made a number of requests for lists of lines from the dataset matching 
various criteria. We're basically looking at various phrasal categories, 
dividing up the child utterances into various types. Below are a few of the 
various phrasal categories we're considering.

    Describe other phrasal categories being considered.

Bare Noun
---------

We are defining bare nouns as nouns produced without any type of modifier before them. Bare nouns may occur in either the presence or absence of other speech, but when there is other speech, none of it directly modifies the noun.  Bare nouns make up a large proportion of one word utterances, but there are many nouns that may also appear as bare nouns in fluent adult speech. Examples below.

    I want *cookie*                     I want a *cookie*
    I don't want *watermelon*           I want more *watermelon*
    *Train* have to go                  The purple *train* have to go
    There go *car*                      There go that *car*
