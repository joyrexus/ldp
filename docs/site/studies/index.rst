Reading Comprehension
=====================

Ece Demir is leading a study looking at early predictors of children's reading
comprehension. With respect to child measures, this study will examine how
children's early oral language, vocabulary and syntactic growth, relates to
their reading comprehension growth during early school ages. Parental input and
oral language comprehension will also be considered. See :doc:`reading`
for more details.


Narrative Development
=====================

With this broad line of research, Ece Demir et al. investigate the narrative 
development of both P2 (normally developing) and P3 (brain-injured) children. 
They examine not only children's speech but also their gestures.  Multiple 
story-stimuli (cartoons, a story stems, a picture book, and naturalistic interactions) 
are presented to child subjects in order to solicit their narrative re-tellings. 
See :doc:`narrative` for more details.


Literacy Study
==============

In this study, Ece Demir et al. consider parental talk about letters and print
related concepts during early home visits. They're investigating (1) whether early 
literacy input is related to children’s later decoding outcomes; and (2) if the 
effect of literacy input is over and above factors such as parent SES or overall 
amount of input. See :doc:`literacy` for more details.


Writing Skills
==============

In this study, Ece Demir et al. are investigating children’s writing skills and
how different stages of writing (planning versus motor execution) are influenced
by different word properties (such as frequency). They asked both P2 (normally 
developing) and P3 (brain-injured) children to write single words on CogSketch tablets.
See :doc:`cogsketch` for more details.


Decontextualized Speech
=======================

Ece Demir is leading a study examining the use of decontextualized language 
(language that is removed from the here-and-now) in the early home
environment. The study is looking at both typically-developing children and 
children with early brain injury. For more info see :doc:`dxt`.


Directed/Overheard Speech
=========================

Laura Schneidman is investigating the characteristics of speech overheard by 
children at 14 months and exploring variability in the attentional behaviors 
of children that might relate to their ability to learn from overheard 
speech. She's found that speech overheard by children differ from speech
directed to them in ways that may potentially make overheard speech a
difficult source of input to learn lexical items from.  See
:doc:`overheard` for more details.


Noun Phrase Study
=================

Erica, Dea and Susan Goldin-Meadow are investigating the development of noun
phrases in speech and speech with gesture.  For more info see :ref:`np-study`.


Lexical Richness
================

Matt Carlson is leading a study that seeks to derive improved measures of 
lexical richness (or vocabulary diversity).  He's exploring a range of 
techniques that address some of the inherent problems inherent in such a
measure.  For more information see :doc:`vocd`.


Phonological Complexity
=======================

Matt Carlson is leading a study that seeks to describe the development of 
phonological structure in child and child-directed speech using metrics of 
word similarity and phonological probability The study aims to develop 
measures of phonological complexity that can be used to predict later 
language development such as decoding skills in reading.  For more information 
see :doc:`phon`.


World of Words
==============

We are currently preparing to publish the set of words used by caregivers
online as a resource for other researchers. This will take the form of a
searchable database that returns word frequencies, the numbers of caregivers 
and children using the words, and related measures over the time course of 
the study.  For more information see :doc:`wow`.
