Overview by Audience
********************

Below is a description of the various types of documentation currently
available for members of our project. 

Research Assistants
===================

Our :ref:`Transcription Guide <tg>` describes how to transcribe visit videos.
It's your one stop shop for all our transcription rules and conventions. If you're doing transcription you'll be referencing it often.

Our :ref:`First Level Gesture Guide <g1>` describes how to annotate gesture on the first pass. This guide is primarily intended for those research assistants coding gesture in conjunction with speech, though second level gesture coders may find this information helpful as well.

Our :ref:`Second Level Gesture Guide <g2>` describes the workflow of a second level gesture coder, including how to prep a speech reliable transcript for gesture coding and how to approach a few problems that might arise.

Our :ref:`Morphosyntax Guide <mg>` describes how to add part-of-speech and
syntax annotation to transcript utterances. This is currently a work in
progress.

Researchers
===========

If you're entirely new to our project you might want to have a look at `this 
announcement <http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/080612/nih.shtml>`_ describing our 
renewal grant. It provides a nice overview of our project's scope and 
objectives. Our :doc:`Project Description <portfolio/proj_desc>` page has 
additional details.

Our :doc:`Studies <studies/index>` page describes various investigations that have been conducted or are currently underway. If you're interested in using our project data for an exploratory study, have a look at our **Study Quickstart Guide** (forthcoming).

Many of these studies have resulted in published papers. See our :doc:`Research
Portfolio <portfolio/index>` for abstracts and links.

For descriptions of the various surveys, tests, and assessments administered in
the course of our study see our :doc:`Tasks <tasks/index>` page.

For an overview of other data we're collecting on our subjects see our
:doc:`Data Resources Guide <guides/data/index>`.


Doc Contributors
================

Our :doc:`tip sheet <tips>` describes how you can use Sphinx and resructured text to produce offical project documentation. The :doc:`to do <todo>` page lists the various things that need to be done on the site.
