Clausal Complement

* I *know* **how he feels**. 
* I *heard* him **shout**.


Clausal Adjunct
---------------

Number of finite and non-finite clauses in an adjunct relationship to a verb -- in other words, clauses which serve a role similar to the role of an adverb.

* I *walked* **when I went to the store**.
* I *walked* **because I wanted to**.
* I *walk* **because I can**.

Negative examples:

* Quickly, **while it's still sunny**.

-----------------

* It *sounds* **like heâ€™s nice**.
* This *is* **how it works**.

Negative examples:

* This *is* the way [that] **it works**.
