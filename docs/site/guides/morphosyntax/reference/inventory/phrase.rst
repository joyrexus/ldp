Phrase Categories
*****************


Below we define a number of phrase categories.  We consider a phrase to be any
group of words functioning as a conceptual unit.

For each phrase category, we'll typically give examples (both positive and
negative) to help illuminate the category and criteria for membership.  For
brevity, we'll use plus and minus signs (``+`` and ``-``) to indicate positive
and negative examples, respectively.  For example phrases that we find
ambiguous, such that the criteria we've laid out are insufficient for 
determining category membership, we'll use a question mark (``?``) to 
indicate the example's ambiguous nature.

For all instances on this page, the terms "Verb" and "Noun" correspond to the fully inclusive definitions previously given.

Morphologically Modified Verb 
=============================

We do not have a count of all verbs modified morphologically in any way, but we have the following subtypes of modification using a morpheme or particle:

Past Tense Verb
---------------

Number of times a verb appears conjugated in the past tense.

Examples:

* She **was walking**.
* She **walked**.
* She **was going to walk**.

Negative examples:

* A **watched** pot never boils.

Infinitive Verb
---------------

Number of times a verb appears in the infinitive, including within a verb phrase that is itself finite, but excluding cases where the verb is elided.  The reason we exclude these cases is that our transcription does not distinguish forms like "I want to" from the fused form "I wanna."

* **To err** is human, **to forgive** divine. 
* I used **to walk**.

Negative Examples:

* I walked **to the store**.
* I want **to**.


Progressive Verb
----------------

Number of times a verb or auxiliary appears in the progressive aspect and serves a verbal role. 

* I was **going** to walk.
* I’m **walking**.

Negative Examples:

* **Walking** is good exercise.
* The **walking** man smiled.


Third Person Singular Verb
--------------------------

Number of times a verb or auxiliary marked for the third person singular appears, excluding the copula (i.e. the word “is” when used as a verb and not an auxiliary).

* John **walks**.
* John **is walking**.

Negative Examples:

* John **is** nice.
* I saw him **walk**.


Verb with Particle
------------------

Number of times a verb appears with at least one particle, as defined by our coding system.  A verbal particle is a preposition that is required by the verb in order to have the meaning that it has, and does not convey real prepositional information.  

* I **threw up**.
* I **threw** my lunch **up**.

Negative Examples:

* I **threw** the ball **up** the field.


Miscellaneous Morphologically Modified Verb
-------------------------------------------

All other forms of morphological verb modification not covered in the preceding categories (i.e. verbs with particles, infinitives, third singulars, past tense, and progressives).  This includes verbs in the conditional, perfect, first singular, first/third singular, and present.

* I *could* eat.
* I *am* going to.

Negative Examples:

Prepositional Phrases
=====================


Preposition as Root
-------------------

Number of times a prepositional phrase appears as the root of an utterance (i.e. does not modify any other clause or word), excluding cases where the copula is dropped but is semantically present.

* **Under the bridge**.
* **Over there** in the bushes.

Negative examples:

* [Where is that guy?]  That guy [is] **over there**.
* [Which guy?]  That *guy* **over there**.
