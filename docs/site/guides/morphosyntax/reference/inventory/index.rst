Inventory
*********

This section of the Morphosyntax Guide is to serve as a reference
for the LDP's nascent inventory of grammatical categories.

We're interested in identifying the onset and frequency of various grammatical
phenomena in our subjects.  The inventory is our attempt to make explicit
both how we understand these grammatical categories and how we use the 
morphosyntactic annotation in a transcript to identify uses of a particular
category.

We've come up with definitions for grammatical categories at various levels.
In particular, we have grammatical categories for four distinct units of
speech:

* word
* phrase
* clause
* utterance

For each category, we'll try to provide:

* a definition or description
* examples, both positive and negative
* a description of how we try to automatically identify usage instances
* any caveats or issues with such automatic identification
