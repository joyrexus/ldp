General Rules for Coding
************************

Watch the entire video and follow along with the transcript. Use the transcriber's coding of gesture to help you focus on sections likely to contain gestures, but do not limit yourself to coding the gestures that have been previously identified. If you need to add in gestures that the transcriber did not see, then make sure that you include the :ref:`first-level gesture codes <g1-reference>` as well.

When a gesture occurs, every cell in the columns for the second-level gesture coding should contain a value. Values that cannot exist because of a lack of speech or because we do not code a particular variable for the observed gesture type should be given as "X" or "NA."

If more than one variable is given in a cell (indicating multiple gestures or ambiguity), then every other cell in that row should similarly be given two values.
