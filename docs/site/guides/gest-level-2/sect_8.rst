*****************
Conventional List
*****************

Conventional Gestures are not coded as fully as representational or deictic gestures. This is because they have a similar form and meaning every time they are used and often do not have an explicit relationship to the corresponding speech.

The following categories are coded for conventional gestures: 

 * G-Type = C (except for give)
 * G-S relation = RF most of the time, but check the chart below
 * Timing is coded as for all other gestures
 * Semantic Correlates should be coded only for Nods and Shakes

(No other info is coded for conventionals, but all cells should be marked X as placeholders.)


See the gesture chart on the documentation page of the :ref:`Language Development Project website <g1-reference>` for a list of currently coded conventional gestures.
