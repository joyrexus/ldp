*************************************
Second Level Gesture Annotation Guide
*************************************

The goal of this manual is to provide descriptions and examples of the variables used to code the gestures that hearing children produce during development. These coding guidelines include the initial categories defined by Seyda Ozcaliskan and Susan Goldin-Meadow in 2004 and used from 2004-2008 as well as the additional variables defined by Erica Cartmill and Susan Goldin-Meadow in 2008. An effort had been made not to change the 2004 coding variables, but rather to append new categories when necessary. In this way, coding from both the 2004-2008 and 2008-present periods should be directly comparable for the 2004 categories. Any changes or additions to the 2004 variables have been noted in the text where appropriate.

The GX transcription rules (gesture codes from Erica Cartmill, which include G_Type, GS_Relationship, Time, Time_General, Word, Word Number, Semantic Role, Presence of Referent, and Reinforced/Added/Perspective for iconic gestures) were used to code the 09H and 10H transcripts for both P2 and P3 participants. All subjects' transcripts have GS transcription rules (from Seyda Ozcaliskan, which include G_Type and GS_Relationship) completed for 01H through 08H. As of 11H, the time general column will be left blank because the information in this column can be obtained by looking at the Time and corresponding CHAT enumerated columns. P2 transcripts before 11H do not have the edit and edit_note columns.
