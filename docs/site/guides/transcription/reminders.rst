Reminders
*********

* Timestamp every other minute to make things easier for you and other transcribers/coders later.

* Timestamp every five minutes when somebody other than the PCG is overheard speaking (indicated with ``x`` in the *key* column) or speaks directly to the child (indicated with ``xc`` in the *key* column).

* Indicate ``x`` and ``xc`` on separate rows.

* Do not put punctuation after ``###``. (Good: ``but i want ###`` ; Bad: ``but i want ###.``)

* Keep track of idiosyncratic speech in the *Notes* section on the info page.

* Keep track of the cast of characters and variant names used for cast members in the *Cast* section on the info page. For more info see :ref:`tg-cast`.

* Don't be lazy! If you hear something that seems like it should be a word but you don't know it (e.g. it's a foreign language or cultural reference), look it up on the internet. Don't just put ### or NAME unless you have to.
