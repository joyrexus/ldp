unsure of. For most normal words, we simply use standard American spelling
found in any American dictionary.  For a list of conventional spellings of 
non-word communicative sounds and words not found in the dictionary, consult

============================  ================================================

.. admonition:: Be sure to capitalize familial terms!

    All familial terms can be used as proper or common nouns, and must be capitalized accordingly.  If one of these terms is being used as a proper noun, transcribe it with an initial capital letter.  One way to tell if it is being used as a proper noun is to see if it could be standing in place of the person's actual name.  If it is being used as a common noun, transcribe it in all lower-case.  Common nouns usually have a possessive or an article in front of it (e.g. "your daddy", "the mommy", "an auntie of mine").

Letter sounds
--------------------

When the child sounds out the letter instead of saying its name, use these standard spellings. In general, consonants are sounded out using the consonant followed by ``uh.`` Some consonants, such as S and R, are sounded out by double letters. Vowels are either in the form "ah"
with a vowel plus h, or "ash" with two vowels plus h. Example: "B says buh, R says
rr". "Can you make the sound that S makes?" "ss."

If they sound out the letter to "sound exactly as the name of the letter, such as vowel long
sounds, type the name of the letter again. For example E makes the E sound, and I
makes the I sound when they are long vowels" vs. "E makes the eh sound and I makes
the ih sound when they are short vowels."
