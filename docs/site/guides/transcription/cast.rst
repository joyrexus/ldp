Cast Information
****************

The info worksheet contains a *Cast* section, which is where you shoud list the
various individuals interacting with the child subject or primary caregivers
during a visit.

Cast Member Codes
=================

The following table indicates the codes used for indicating common cast
members.

=========  ================================
Code       Cast Member
=========  ================================
M          Mother
F          Father
E          Experimenter
GM         Grandmother
GF|GP      Grandfather
OF         Older Female (non-sibling)
OM         Older Male (non-sibling)
OS         Older Sister

=========  ================================


Variant names
=============

The Cast section should also be used to list variant names used for cast
members in the course of the visit. For example, if the child subject is named
"Thomas" and the parents referred to Thomas as "Tom", "Tommy", and "T-Bone"
you'd enter the following in the Cast field::

    C=Thomas {Tom, Tommy, T-Bone}

It is important to list any variant names that might point to the child's identity (or family's identity). Though it may seem silly to list "T-Bone" in the cast information, it is important to do so because it hints that the child's name begins with "t." On the other hand, it is not necessary to list here that the mother often calls Thomas "kiddo" or "pookie" or that his older brother calls him "boogerface" because these do not give any clues as to his given name.


Who to include in the cast
==========================

Include in the cast field anyone present at the session whose name is mentioned at least once. This will almost always be C and PCG (either by name or by "Mommy," "Dada," etc.) and will often include siblings and the experimentor as well. If one of the above characters is mentioned but is not present at the session, it is not necessary to include him or her in the cast field. Also note that when including siblings in the cast field, use SIB (or SIB1, SIB2, etc.) rather than the other older sibling codes.
