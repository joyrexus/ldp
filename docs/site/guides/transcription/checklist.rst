Submission Checklist
********************

So let's assume you've got everything transcribed and annotated. Here are the
last few steps you need to do before you can submit your completed transcript.

Fill out the info worksheet
===========================

Be sure to fill out the appropriate sections of the info worksheet of your
transcript. (The green section should be filled out by base level transcribers,
the yellow section by second-level gesture annotators, etc.)

Specify transcription version
-----------------------------

In the *Transcription Version No.* field you need to indicate which version of
the Transcription Guide you were using when doing the transcription. We 
periodically add new rules to the Transcription Guide. Whenever we do this, we
increment the version number of the Guide. By noting which version of the Guide
you used we'll know exactly which rules you used when you were transcribing.
The current version of the Guide you're now reading can be found at the top of
the  :ref:`Revision History <tg-revisions>`. For example, if the top line of
the Revision History reads "Version 1.2.1", you would fill out the *Transcription Version No.* field with "1.2.1".

List cast members and variant names
-----------------------------------

See :ref:`tg-cast`.

Enter spontaneous speech time
-----------------------------

Calculate and enter the total time of spontaneous speech in the *Spontaneous
Speech Time* field. To do this [brief description of how to calculate speech
time].

Run spell-check
===============

Make sure there are no empty lines
==================================

Fill in line column completely
==============================

Place END markers in context column
===================================

* Insert "END OF TAPE 1" on its own line in the context column.
* Insert "END OF TAPE 2" on its own line in the context column.
* Insert "END OF TRANSCRIPT" on its own line in the context column.

Check the format of the transcript file name
============================================

Make sure the file is properly named using the following format::

    <subject>.<visit>.<project>.xls

For example, if you had transcribed a home visit of a normally developing (i.e., Project 2) subject, say subject ID number 22, at session nine (46 months) the file should be named ``22.09H.P2.xls``

Note that daycare (D) and home (H) visits are specified somewhat differently than literacy visits. The former are specified by the session number and visit type, whereas literacy visits are specified by grade, visit #, and year (e.g., ``22.KG_1_07.P2.xls``).
