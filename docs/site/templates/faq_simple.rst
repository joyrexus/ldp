.. _q1:

1. How do I make a simple FAQ?
==============================

To make a simple FAQ just use this template and modify it. Replace this
question and answer with your own and duplicate as necessary.

Note that ``_my-faq`` should be changed to some unique name for your FAQ so you
and others can refer to it in other parts of the collected documentation. For
example, we can link to the :ref:`Transcription Guide FAQ <tg-faq>` because 
it's uniquely identified as ``tg-faq``.

.. _q2:

2. How do I link the questions to their answers?
================================================

Use ``.. _q#`` to label a question and answer. The label for this question and
answer is ``.. _q2``. Here is how you would link to :ref:`question one <q1>`.
