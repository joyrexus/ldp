Job Runner
==========


Metadata for User-Created Notes
-------------------------------

It would potentially be useful for user-created notes added to job files to have some metadata 
detailing when the note was written, and by whom. This could come in handy when user A wants to 
leave a note detailing some general issue across the job file, and user B is later editing the 
same job file and wants to talk to user A to clarify what she meant in her note.

Colorization of Problematic Words in Context
--------------------------------------------

When within the edit loop in the editor, one can enter a 'c' command in order to print several 
lines of context surrounding the utterance she is attempting to correct. It would be much easier 
to spot the problematic word(s) within the utterance in question, especially amongst the additional 
lines of context, if the problematic word(s) were colored in the same way as when the utterance 
is shown out of context.
