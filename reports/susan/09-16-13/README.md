    Hi Jason, Susan Levine wanted to check something stated in a recent 
    paper that was submitted by Susan G-M and others on the BI kids.  
    She wanted to check to see how often each BI kid uses which hand when 
    they gesture, and how that compares to the TD kids at two timepoints, 
    05H and 08H.  Furthermore, she is interested in if the handedness of 
    the gesture differs based on the type of gesture (deictic, 
    representational, conventional, etc.).  

    Subjects/sessions:  all P2 and P3 kids who have both 05H and 08H visits

    Utterances:  from the above sessions, utterances that include an "L", "R", 
    or "B" in the c_lrb column (this includes when two gestures are coded in 
    the same cell, e.g., "L + L").
