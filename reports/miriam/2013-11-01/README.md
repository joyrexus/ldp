# catcorr demo

Create a follow-up report for Miriam Novack and render results with [dc.js](http://nickqizhu.github.io/dc.js/) to demonstrate its potential for exploratory analysis. 

Miriam had previously requested MLU results for all Project 2 subjects at
sessions 8 and 9.  Here we've generated a report with all speech summary measures for the same subjects.
