Miriam and Laura would like child utterances along with their clause and noun
phrase counts for 18 subjects for which such annotation is available.

Update: Miriam would also like a second report (see `report-2.tsv`) containing
all P2 child utterances along with the available part-of-speech annotation (`c_mor`).

    Subject: request for Program Project data

    I'd like to request some Program Project data. Laura Shniedman and I are doing a project on overheard syntax, and we'd like the child speech utterance syntax coding from the 42 month session. We're planning on coding whether their utterances are noun clauses, simple clauses, or complex clauses. I think that we can get that information from the `c_clauses` and `c_np` columns. Does that seem right?

    Hi Jason,
    Thanks for following up! So we might want to look at certain types of
    subjects, so I think that we'll need more than just the 18. If you could
    get us the 18 subjects with the syntax coding, and then the rest of the
    subjects with whatever they have (the morphology and part of speech) that
    would be a great start.
