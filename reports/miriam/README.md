    Subject: request for Program Project data

    I'd like to request some Program Project data. Laura Shniedman and I are doing a project on overheard syntax, and we'd like the child speech utterance syntax coding from the 42 month session. We're planning on coding whether their utterances are noun clauses, simple clauses, or complex clauses. I think that we can get that information from the `c_clauses` and `c_np` columns. Does that seem right?
