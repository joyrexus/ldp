# Request

Miriam would like a list of all iconic gestures produced by the parents of P2 subjects from the home visit transcripts.

    Previously, maybe a year ago, you had pulled out all of the child iconic gestures from sessions 1-10. Can you do the same things for the parents? We'll need all of the available information associated with those gestures - the timestamps, transcription line, gloss, utteraences, etc.

    Erica says that she can't find her original request, but looking at 
    the codes, it seems that I want the "R" codes, specifically R.a, R.d, 
    R.m, and R.pp. (I do not however need the R.met gestures).
