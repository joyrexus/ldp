Miriam would like a list of all iconic gestures produced by the parents of P2 subjects from sessions 1 to 10 of the home visits.

Previously, maybe a year ago, you had pulled out all of the child iconic gestures from sessions 1-10. Can you do the same things for the parents? We'll need all of the available information associated with those gestures - the timestamps, transcription line, gloss, utteraences, etc.
