Steve Raudenbush has requested "a person period data set with the reading measures as outcomes for the TD sample (typically-developing subjects)."

For this we generated a `reading.xls` file containing the following columns:

* SUBJ: subject ID
* SESS: session ID
* AGE: approximate subject age (in months)
* WJ: Woodcock-Johnson Word ID score
* GM: Gates-MacGinitie Reading Comprehension
