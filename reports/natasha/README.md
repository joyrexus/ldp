# Request

Natasha Abner is interested in the gesture-speech relations occurring in both parent and child utterances.  She is requesting all parent and child utterances for the 18 subjects that received morphosyntactic annotation across all home visit sessions (1 to 12).  

The requested archive of transcript utterances can be [downloaded here](http://joyrexus.spc.uchicago.edu/ldp/temp/natasha/request.zip).


## Updates

**31-10-2013**: revised `query.py` and used `make.sh` script to generate transcript utterance listings for each home visit session. For example, `sessions/1.xls` contains all utterances from session 1.
