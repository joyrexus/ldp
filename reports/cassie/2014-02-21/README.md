Cassie would like a report indicating the number of verbs used by each period-1 child and parent at each visit.

## Email to Cassie for clarification

You had also requested a report indicating the number of verbs used by each
child and each parent at each visit for the normally developing subjects.

Were you interested in the number of unique verbs (used by each speaker at a
visit) or just the total number of verbs used?  I.e., verb type or token
totals?

Caveat regarding identifying verb forms: there’s some ambiguity with auxiliary
forms and participles when making compound verb forms, e.g.: “want to”, "is
going”, “has been”.  The POS is often ambiguous even with the syntactic
annotation, which is only available on a subset of subjects (12 total).  I’m
just going to try to identify word tokens tagged with `v` and ignore any `aux`
or `part` tags for now.  If this is a concern I’d be happy to discuss.
