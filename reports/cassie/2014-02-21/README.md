Find the onset of iconic gestures for the subjects in group-1 (normally developing subjects).  I.e., list the session number where an iconic gesture is first used.


## Files

* `query.py` - the query script used to generate report
* `report.tsv` - the requested report

The report file contains three columns:

* `SUBJ` - subject ID
* `ONSET` - session in which an iconic was first used by subject
* `COUNT` - number of iconics used at onset


## Notes

The [gesture type column](http://joyrexus.spc.uchicago.edu/ldp/docs/specs/transcript/columns/g_type.html) was used to identify iconic gestures.

* `R.a` - Representing attribute. 
  Iconic gesture characterizing an entity by means of specifying an 
  attribute or a part associated with the entity, or the entity itself.

* `R.d` - Representing direction.  
  Iconic gesture characterizing the direction of the motion.

* `R.m` -  Representing motion.
  Iconic gesture characterizing an entity by means of an action associated 
  with the entity.

* `R.met` - Representing metaphoric.
  Representational gesture indicating a metaphorical object or movement.

I was wondering if you could pull data on the onset of iconic gestures for each LDP P2 kid. I'm interested in the first time that each child created an iconic gesture to compare it with onset of higher order thinking (which we're coding). 

Could I also get the number of verbs used by each child and each parent at each visit? (SGM and I have a hypothesis we're testing about the relationship between verb complexity and HOT.)
