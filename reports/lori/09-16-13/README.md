Lori Petersen is requesting two reports:

A listing of P2 child utterances ...

1. from sessions 1-7 with  an `R` in the **key** column.

2. from sessions 4-9 matching `\b(build|lego|block)`. 

See `report-1.xls` for (1) and `report-2.xls` for (2).

Note that I actually included parent utterances in the first report if the
child was being read to because I wasn't sure whether you wanted them included
or not.  You can of course filter out any rows where the child utterance column
is blank if you so desire.

    I am interested in looking at videos in which children are interacting with blocks (both traditional and lego) and books.

    Would you be able to send me portions of the data in which the words "build," "lego," and "block" are uttered and the code "r" is used? 

    In particular ...

    (1) Reading instances (key "r") from Project 2 children from 
    14-, 18-, 22-, 26-, 30-, 34-, and 38-months.

    (2) Block instances ("build," "lego," or "block") from Project 2 children
    at 26-, 30-, 34-, 38-, 42-, and 46- months.
