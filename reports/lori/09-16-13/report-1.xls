125	4		436	R	"she gathered up all the goodies in one big load."		
125	4		437	R	"mama, cried Sister_Bear."		
125	4		438	R	"what are you doing?"		
125	4	00:20:36	439	R	"you're not going to throw them away, cried Brother."		
125	4		440	R	"no, we're going to put them in the freezer and forget about them, she said."		
125	4		441	R	"there's no use arguing."		
125	4		442	R	"that's right, agreed Papa coming in from his shop."		
125	4		443	R	"there's no use arguing with your Mother when she's made up her mind."		
125	4		444	R	"then looking into the refrigerator he said, oh dear."		
125	4		445	R	"we're out of Sweetsie_Cola."		
125	4		446	R	"let's be sure to get some next time we're at the supermarket."		
125	4		447	R	"our Sweetsie_Cola days are over, said mama."		
125	4		448	R	"as she pushed all the goodies into the freezer two packages fell to the floor."		
125	4		449	R	"say, shouted Papa."		
125	4		450	R	"what are you doing with Sugar_Balls and Coco_Chums?"		
125	4		451	R	"they're going into the freezer and we're going to forget about them, cried Brother."		
125	4		452	R	"we're going to eat healthy and nourishing food instead."		
125	4		453	R	"just a minute, said Papa."		
125	4		454	R	"but as he leaned over to pick up his precious goodies there was a loud -- rip."		
125	4	00:21:33	455	R	"papa's snack habits had caught up with him too."		
125	4		456	R	"he had split the seat of his overalls wide open."		
125	4		457	R	"what sort of healthy nourishing food, Papa asked mama as she sewed up his overalls."		
125	4		458	R	"vegetables right out of our garden, of course, and fruit from our orchard."		
125	4		459	R	"and what are -- "		
125	4		464	R	"and what are we -- "		
125	4		469	R	"what are -- "		
125	4		473	R	"what are we supposed to drink, asked Papa?"		
125	4		474	R	"try this, she said."		
125	4		475	R	"it's called -- water."		
125	4		476	R	"the next day the Bear_Family went to the supermarket to buy some sensible food for the pantry."		
125	4		477	R	"mama pushed right past the sweets and goodies and stocked up on wholegrain -- "		
125	4		480	R	" -- wholegrain bread and cereal and fresh milk and cheese, and then she chose some fine looking -- "		
125	4	00:22:43	481	R	" -- oranges and -- "		
125	4		485	R	"two fruits that didn't grow in her orchard."		
125	4		486	R	"while she was waiting in the check+out line someone said I'm glad to see that cart loaded with nutritious food Mama_Bear."		
125	4		487	R	"it was Doctor_Grizzly the Bear's family doctor."		
125	4		490	R	"it was, uh -- you must -- "		
125	4		495	R	"you must believe in good food for a healthy body."		
125	4		496	R	"I certainly do, said mama, but I'm not sure about the rest of my family."		
125	4		501	R	"Doctor_Grizzly took a look at Papa and the cubs."		
125	4		502	R	"hmm, she said."		
125	4		503	R	"I see what you mean."		
125	4		504	R	"they look like they could use a little professional advice."		
125	4		505	R	"stop by my office tomorrow please."		
125	4		506	R	"the cubs were nervous when the all arrived at the doctors office the next day."		
125	4		507	R	"you think she'll give us some sort of shot, they wanted to know."		
125	4		508	R	"I don't think so, said mama."		
125	4		509	R	"but with Doctor_Grizzly you never knew."		
125	4		511	R	"step in here please, said Doctor_Grizzly."		
125	4		514	R	"oh boy, movies, said the cubs."		
125	4		517	R	"not exactly, said the Doctor as she turned out the lights."		
125	4		518	R	"we're going to have a little slideshow."		
125	4		519	R	"about what, asked the cubs."		
125	4		520	R	"you'll see, she said and started the show."		
125	4		521	R	"this is what your body looks like from the outside and this, she said changing the slide, is what it looks like on the inside."		
125	4		522	R	"wow, said the cubs."		
125	4		524	R	"our bodies are a marvelous system of parts called organs and it's these parts working -- "		
125	4		527	R	" -- working together that let us do all the wonderful things we can do."		
125	4		532	R	"climb mountains, sing songs -- "		
125	4		535	R	"it's a number of systems really."		
125	4		538	R	"a system of nerves that let us feel and think."		
125	4		543	R	"a system of muscles and bones that -- lets us move and gives us strength."		
125	4		548	R	"and a system for food that lets us -- "		
125	4		551	R	" -- take in the nourishment that gives us energy and keeps all the other systems healthy."		
125	4		553	R	"the last slide showed different kinds of foods -- "		
125	4		556	R	" -- and told how they help the body."		
125	4		566	R	"papa looked for Sugar_Balls and Coco_Chums but they were nowhere to be seen."		
125	4		599	R	"now, said Doctor_Grizzly turning on the lights."		
125	4		600	R	"I'll do my best to keep you healthy if you'll promise to do your part by eating the right foods."		
125	4		601	R	"we promise, said Brother, but Sister had a question."		
125	4		602	R	"what about sweets and goodies?"		
125	4		603	R	"what harm do they do?"		
125	4		604	R	"most of them, answered the Doctor, aren't very nourishing."		
125	4		605	R	"instead of helping build and strengthen our bodies they just pile up as extra fat like this."		
125	4		606	R	"she took a pinch of Papa's waist and got quite a handful."		
125	4		607	R	"ouch, said Papa, and even -- "		
125	4		610	R	" -- even worse they fill you up so you're not hungry for the food your body really needs."		
125	4		613	R	"and as the bears were leaving -- just a minute, she added."		
125	4		614	R	"oh no a shot, thought the cubs, but that wasn't it at all."		
125	4		619	R	"exercise, called the Doctor."		
125	4		620	R	"and exercise program is important for good health too, and it will work off those extra inches."		
125	4		621	R	"well, said Brother, there's not time like right now."		
125	4		622	R	"let's jog home+."		
125	4		623	R	"and off the cubs went with Papa puffing behind."		
125	4		627	R	"at first it was a little strange eating just good healthy food."		
125	4		628	R	"for a while they could almost -- "		
125	4		632	R	"for a while they could almost taste the Sugar_Balls and Coco_Chums they weren't snacking on."		
125	4		633	R	"but mama was always ready with healthy goodies."		
125	4		634	R	"apple slices for tv, nuts and raisins for the movies, frozen yogurt at the mall, and crisp, crunchy carrot sticks just about anytime."		
125	4		636	R	"the bears started a family exercise program of jogging so when the Bear_Country three mile run was announced they were all slimmed down and ready."		
125	4		637	R	"though they didn't win they didn't come in last either."		
125	4		638	R	"not even Papa."		
125	4		639	R	"and they won a prize for being the only family to finish the whole race."		
125	4		645	R	"they were all excited and proud, especially Papa."		
125	4		648	R	"I know what, he said."		
125	4		649	R	"let's celebrate -- "		
125	4		652	R	" -- by opening up the freezer and -- "		
125	4		653	R	"have a carrot stick, interrupted Brother."		
125	4		654	R	"and some nuts and raisins, added Sister."		
125	4		655	R	"and Papa did."		
125	4		775	R		papa did.	C is "reading" the last line of the book that she has memorized - she's been saying it a lot, but this is the first time it's actually been on the page in front of her.

125	4		1110	R	"we can wish him a happy birth+day at the party, Wendy explained."		
125	4		1111	R	"now remember it's a secret."		
125	4		1112	R	"not a word to Bob."		
125	4		1113	R	"just then Bob came into the yard."		
125	4		1114	R	"hi Wendy, was there any mail for me, he asked."		
125	4		1115	R	"were you expecting anything special?"		
125	4		1116	R	"uh, no, nothing special, he said."		
125	4		1122	R	"he turned to Scoop and Lofty."		
125	4		1132	R	"we have to go and fix Farmer_Pickle's barn."

125	4		1139	R	"have a good day Bob, Wendy called."		
125	4		1140	R	"I'll try, mumbled Bob as he rolled out of the yard with Scoop and Lofty."		
125	4		1141	R	"Wendy sighed, now I can begin baking Bob's birth+day cake."		
125	4		1155	R	"when Bob, Scoop, and Lofty got to Farmer_Pickle's yard Travis and Spud were already there."		
125	4		1156	R	"Bob started to pull the old planking off the wall so he could replace it with new planking."		
125	4		1157	R	"pull harder Bob, yelled Spud."		
125	4		1158	R	"I'm doing my best, grunted Bob."		
125	4		1159	R	"Suddenly the plank came loose and Bob fell on -- back on his bottom."		
125	4	00:02:27	1160	R	"things weren't going that well for Bob on his birth+day."		
125	4		1161	R	"back at the yard Dizzy and Muck watched Wendy make Bob's birth+day cake."		
125	4		1162	R	"cake mixing looks easy, said Dizzy."		
125	4		1163	R	"just throw everything together and mix it up."		
125	4		1164	R	"just like making concrete."		
125	4		1165	R	"hey, why don't we make Bob a concrete cake he can keep forever."		
125	4		1166	R	"can we make it?"		
125	4		1167	R	"asked Muck."		
125	4		1168	R	"exclaimed Dizzy."		
125	4		1169	R	"dizzy whipped up a load of her very best concrete then she poured it into a tire mold."		
125	4		1170	R	"well then Rolly helped Muck and Dizzy decorate their concrete cake with some flowers, feathers and leaves."		
125	4		1171	R	"wow, cool cake, Lily said."		
125	4		1172	R	"at Farmer_Pickle's barn Bob and Lofty were still working hard."		
125	4		1173	R	"their work was coming along nicely."		
125	4		1174	R	"Travis and Spud, aren't you two supposed to be delivering Farmer_Pickle's eggs asked Bob."		
125	4		1175	R	"you're right, said Travis starting up his engine."		
125	4		1176	R	"come on Spud, he called."		
125	4		1177	R	"I'll drop you off at Bob's house."		
125	4	00:03:32	1178	R	"at Bob's house Wendy was done baking Bob's birth+day cake."		
125	4		1179	R	"mmm, exclaimed Spud as he scooped some icing off the cake and plopped it into his mouth."		
125	4		1180	R	"spud, Wendy yelled."		
125	4		1181	R	"I'm sorry Wendy, Spud mumbled, but it looked so good."		
125	4		1182	R	"do you want to help me put the candles on the cake, asked Wendy."		
125	4		1183	R	"you bet, Spud's on the job, he laughed."		
125	4		1184	R	"at last, let's see, Bob nailed the last plank into Farmer_Pickle's barn and his cell+phone rang."		
125	4		1186	R	"maybe this is a birth+day phone call, he said hopefully."		
125	4		1187	R	"it was Wendy."		
125	4		1188	R	"hi Bob, she said."		
125	4		1189	R	"when are you coming home+?"

125	4		1192	R	"any special reason?"		
125	4		1193	R	"no, Wendy replied."

125	4		1195	R	"bye."

125	4		1199	R	"time to go home+, he said."		
125	4	00:04:31	1200	R	"back at the yard Wendy, Muck, Dizzy, and Rolly had decorated a table and covered it with cakes and presents."		
125	4		1201	R	"Bob couldn't believe his eyes when he arrived back at the yard."		
125	4		1202	R	"surprise, laughed Wendy."		
125	4		1203	R	"I thought you forgot my birth+day, Bob explained."		
125	4		1204	R	"forget your birth+day, Wendy teased."		
125	4		1205	R	"never."
