49	8	00:24:12	sometimes -- boys are in a building that may be on fire and the firemen have to rescue them, right?	3	in, on, right	
49	8	00:24:12	because -- um, and it's a tall building.	1	tall	
49	8	00:24:12	if it's like four stories -- like forty feet up -- boys don't want to jump out the window and their Mommies.	2	up, out	
54	7	00:33:38	it's the stuff at the very bottom to make sure it's -- it's -- got to be level and it's something to -- hard -- hard for it to --	1	bottom	
54	7	00:33:38	something for it to, um, sit on.	1	on	
54	7	00:33:38	well the foundation is the bottom.	1	bottom	
54	7	00:33:38	now since that was your building, that's ok that you knock it down.	1	down

72	4	00:15:11	that a big one?	1	big	
72	4	00:15:11	and then we could build a really big slide like this.	1	big	
72	5	00:26:05	they'll wait for the leggos to come, right.	1	right	
72	5	00:26:05	let's put some on there for them, ok?	2	some, on

72	5	00:27:07	you want to build something with a window for them?	1	with	
72	5	00:27:07	should we put a window in there?	1	in	
72	5	00:29:00	you can put half of it on there.	2	half, on	
72	5	00:29:00	must be -- over here.	1	over	
72	5	00:29:00	it's over on this side.	3	over, on, side	
72	5	00:29:00	oh, the front.	1	front	
72	5	00:29:00	we have to look for that piece.	1	piece	
72	5	00:29:00	let's see if we can find that little piece.	2	little, piece	
72	5	00:29:00	maybe it's in here.	1	in	
72	5	00:29:00	not in this box.	1	in	
72	5	00:29:00	it might be in the other box.	1	in	
72	5	00:31:51	I think the other one is red, right?	1	right	
72	5	00:31:51	I don't see it in here.	1	in	
72	5	00:31:51	I think we're going to have to look around for it.	1	around	
72	5	00:31:51	it might be -- under the couch or something.	1	under	
72	5	00:31:51	I don't see it in the box.	1	in	
72	5	00:31:51	later on saturday?	1	on	
72	5	00:33:12	clips in there ### click, and -- and then you close it it goes -- click.	2	in, close	
72	5	00:33:12	is there a clock in there?	1	in	
72	5	00:33:12	you can see out the window?	1	out	
72	5	00:34:05	why don't we put, um, some people on this side of the window and then somebody on the other side of the window and then they can talk to each other.	5	some, on, side, on, side	
72	5	00:34:05	here, how about this one?	1	about	
72	5	00:34:05	here, these are some -- people who can talk to each other -- through the window if you want to.	2	some, through	
72	5	00:34:05	I don't think he fits on there.	1	on	
72	5	00:34:05	even though he has a hole on the bottom he doesn't fit on there because he didn't come with the leggos.	4	on, bottom, on, with	
72	5	00:34:05	he came with a different --	1	with	
72	5	00:34:05	he came with a farm, remember?	1	with	
72	5	00:34:05	he's part of the farm set.	1	part	
72	5	00:34:05	so he's not -- doesn't fit on a leggo unfortunately.	1	on	
72	5	00:34:05	the little boy?	1	little	
72	5	00:34:05	I don't know where that little boy went.	1	little	
72	5	00:34:05	they live on the farm, right.	2	on, right	
72	5	00:34:05	I don't see the little boy.	1	little	
72	5	00:34:05	I think there was only one horse -- that came with it.	1	with	
72	5	00:27:10	how about if I -- how about if I cut up an apple for you?	3	about, about, up	
72	5	00:27:10	how about if I cut up an apple.	2	about, up	
72	5	00:27:10	how about apple+sauce?	1	about	
72	7	00:36:54	you could play with them.	1	with	
72	7	00:36:54	and you know how to play um -- you know all the Dora pieces.	2	all, pieces	
72	7	00:36:54	that goes on top huh?	2	on, top	
72	7	00:36:54	just try -- just try pushing it down a little more.	2	down, little	
72	7	00:36:54	further.	1	further	
72	7	00:38:14	see it has these pieces on the bottom.	3	pieces, on, bottom	
72	7	00:38:14	so it has to fit in just like the Legos do.	1	in	
72	7	00:38:31	we can put Dora on it.	1	on	
72	7	00:38:31	oh you want it next to that?	1	next	
72	7	00:38:31	you want to put it right next to that wall?	2	right, next	
72	7	00:38:31	got to -- find Dora in here.	1	in	
72	7	00:38:31	go ride on that if you want to.	1	on	
72	7	00:39:59	this reminds me of the um slide going into the swimming pool.	1	into	
72	7	00:39:59	remember that slide that we went on.	1	on	
72	7	00:39:59	well we didn't go on it but we saw it.	1	on	
72	7	00:39:59	we saw people going down that slide and they went into that big swimming pool.	3	down, into, big	
72	7	00:39:59	went Galena with Grandma and Grandpa?	1	with	
72	7	00:40:19	they had a big slide that went around and around and then people went down and dropped into the pool.	5	big, around, around, down, into	
72	7	00:40:19	they went right into the pool because it was a lot of fun.	3	right, into, lot	
72	7	00:40:32	the would ride down the slide and go boom right into the swimming pool.	3	down, right, into	
72	7	00:40:32	it's probably in there.	1	in	
72	7	00:40:32	let's look around for it.	1	around	
72	7	00:40:32	oh you're looking for the little car right?	2	little, right	
72	7	00:41:35	right?	1	right	
72	7	00:41:35	and the little car.	1	little	
72	7	00:41:35	we'll have to look around for those.	1	around	
72	7	00:41:35	I don't know they might -- might not be in this bin.	1	in	
72	7	00:41:35	### a good piece.	1	piece	
72	7	00:42:09	and look who I found on the yellow car.	1	on	
72	7	00:42:09	but I haven't seen it in here.	1	in	
72	7	00:42:09	you can make him stand on there.	1	on	
72	7	00:44:32	see he's sitting one side.	1	side	
72	7	00:44:32	so it just stays down on one side.	3	down, on, side	
72	7	00:44:32	he weighs it down.	1	down	
72	7	00:44:32	because he's the only one on the swing.	1	on	
72	7	00:44:32	she has to weigh it on the other side.	2	on, side	
72	7	00:44:32	right?	1	right	
72	7	00:44:32	yeah it works a little bit better.	2	little, bit	
72	7	00:44:32	so see how her side stays down a little more?	3	side, down, little	
72	7	00:45:24	so we can find something to weigh his side down a little more.	3	side, down, little	
72	7	00:45:24	what could we add to his side?	1	side	
72	7	00:46:31	is it going in the pool?	1	in	
72	7	00:46:31	he's going to go in the pool.	1	in	
72	7	00:48:31	try her on top.	2	on, top	
72	7	00:48:31	wonder why it doesn't stand up.	1	up	
72	7	00:48:55	I guess because it was -- I think it was -- just on an angle from one of these little Lego -- um Lego holes.	3	on, angle, little	
72	7	00:48:55	I don't think it will Peek because I don't think -- I think for these pieces they have to have room.	1	pieces	
72	7	00:49:32	see how his feet don't have enough room with the Lego there?	2	enough, with	
72	7	00:49:49	they have to have two legs -- two lines of Lego spots.	1	lines	
72	7	00:49:49	the little holes.	1	little	
72	7	00:49:49	and then she has to go up there.	1	up	
72	7	00:49:49	she can't go in one next to him because she has to have enough room.	3	in, next, enough	
72	7	00:49:49	she's turning around huh?	2	turning, around	
72	7	00:49:49	let's get something we can build a door with.	1	with	
72	7	00:49:49	on that side?	2	on, side	
72	7	00:49:49	and then we put one on top.	2	on, top	
72	7	00:49:49	oh, we need a bigger one.	1	bigger	
72	7	00:49:49	where's a really really big one.	1	big	
72	7	00:49:49	do we have any really big ones?	1	big	
72	7	00:49:49	this is perfect size.	1	size	
72	7	00:49:49	you know what, we could build it -- let's make it taller.	1	taller	
72	7	00:49:49	because she doesn't fit in there.	1	in	
72	7	00:49:49	so we'll make it a little taller.	2	little, taller	
72	7	00:49:49	take this piece off.	1	piece	
72	7	00:52:08	and how can we make it taller?	1	taller	
72	7	00:52:08	how can we make it taller?	1	taller	
72	7	00:52:46	and then we have to add one to this side too, right?	2	side, right	
72	7	00:52:46	right?	1	right	
72	7	00:52:46	we need a little one.	1	little	
72	7	00:52:46	just a square one.	1	square	
72	7	00:53:00	and then what do you need to put on top?	2	on, top	
72	7	00:53:00	you need to put the top of the door frame right?	2	top, right	
72	7	00:53:00	like it was before.	1	before	
72	7	00:53:00	and now you've got a taller door.	1	taller	
72	7	00:53:00	so she should fit through there.	1	through	
72	7	00:53:00	right?	1	right	
72	7	00:53:00	we need to make it wider.	1	wider	
72	7	00:53:00	we need to make it wider for her arms I think.	1	wider	
72	7	00:53:00	how can we make it wider?	1	wider	
72	7	00:53:00	but how can we make it wider?	1	wider	
72	7	00:53:00	how do we make it wider for them?	1	wider	
72	7	00:53:00	how can we make it wider for them to fit through?	2	wider, through	
72	7	00:53:58	see their arms are so wide.	1	wide	
72	7	00:54:01	how can we make it wider?	1	wider	
72	7	00:54:01	oh, but you're making it taller.	1	taller	
72	7	00:54:01	see you're making it taller that way.	1	taller	
72	7	00:54:01	right?	1	right	
72	7	00:54:01	how can we make the door wider?	1	wider	
72	7	00:54:01	so they can fit through?	1	through	
72	7	00:54:01	how should we make it wider?	1	wider	
72	7	00:54:01	how about we make it wider.	2	about, wider	
72	7	00:54:01	how about this.	1	about	
72	7	00:54:01	how about this Robert.	1	about	
72	7	00:54:01	what if I move this over like this?	1	over	
72	7	00:54:01	what if I move this piece?	1	piece	
72	7	00:54:01	then maybe they'll fit through.	1	through	
72	7	00:55:01	how did I make it wider?	1	wider	
72	7	00:55:01	now you're making it taller right?	2	taller, right	
72	7	00:55:01	you're making it taller?	1	taller	
72	7	00:55:01	really tall.	1	tall	
72	7	00:55:01	if you put it on --	1	on	
72	7	00:55:01	I'll give you a little hint.	1	little	
72	7	00:55:01	it you put it on this inner one right here it will fit.	2	on, right	
72	7	00:55:01	and it will give you the whole width of the door.	2	whole, width	
72	7	00:55:01	is it going on there?	1	on	
72	7	00:55:01	you have to just line it up right.	3	line, up, right	
72	7	00:56:57	can you line it up?	2	line, up	
72	7	00:56:57	now they go through easily.	1	through	
72	7	00:56:57	because there's enough room for them now.	1	enough	
72	7	00:56:57	why did you make it really tall?	1	tall	
72	7	00:57:17	they needed it to be a little bit taller.	3	little, bit, taller	
72	7	00:57:19	all the way up.	2	all, up	
72	7	00:57:19	she fell over.	1	over

75	8	00:41:47	I will build a bridge and your train can go under the bridge.	1	under	
75	8	00:42:34	see the problem is Joe we can only make it so wide.	1	wide	
75	8	00:42:34	we don't have anything to put across the top.	2	across, top	
75	8	00:42:34	I guess I could put this thing across the top huh?	2	across, top	
75	8	00:42:34	put your train under the bridge.	1	under

75	8	00:44:40	ok, a bridge honey is like two towers that are connected on top and then things go underneath it.	3	on, top, underneath	
75	8	00:44:40	let's have a contest to see who can make theirs the tallest.	1	tallest	
75	8	00:44:40	can you make one that high?	1	high
