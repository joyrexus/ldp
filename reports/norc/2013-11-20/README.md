# README

See [previous README](../2013-11-18/README.md) for context.

The `convert.py` script was used to convert the data file provided by NORC into
a tidier format for querying.

The `compare.py` script was used to generate `compare.tsv` which compares the counts of the `|` delimiter/code found in each story with the clause count judgments made by human reviewers.

It seems the `|` code was used more as a clause *marker* than as a [delimiter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values) separating clause values.
