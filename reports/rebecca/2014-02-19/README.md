Rebecca would like to get the following info for transcripts without cast data indicated on the info worksheet: 

1. a list of counts for each transcript indicating how many parent utterances consisted of just the '---' marker. (See [report-1.tsv](report-1.tsv))

2. a list of transcript line numbers containing both of the two patterns: 

   (talk|say|speak)(s|ing)?|(said|spoke)
   (P|parent|F|father|sib|sibling|sister|brother)

... or something like this.  I don't think the transcribers were at all consistent in how they reported things in the context column, hence the patterns catching:

  parent says to subject
  sib talking
  etc.

For the first request see [report-1.tsv](report-1.tsv) for the second see [report-2.tsv](report-2.tsv).
