# 2014-10-15 

Rebecca Treiman [requested](request.md) an update to a previously requested
report from Oct 20, 2012 (see original [README](original/README.rst)).

At the time, many visits from sessions 11 and 12 had yet to be transcribed.
The [new report](original/report.xls) contains word token counts for all Project 2 transcripts for all transcripts from sessions 11 and 12.  It was generated using the same python script used to create the previously requested report.

We also included a ["speech" report](revised/report.xls) for the same set of transcripts.  The speech report generator was devised at some point in 2013.   These reports include counts for utterances, MLU, word tokens, and word types.  

Note that the word token counts in the speech report differ from the original report due to the fact that clitic forms are split, whereas in Rebecca's original report (and its update) clitic forms were not split.  The earlier postdocs preferred to count clitic forms as single tokens, but later postdocs preferred to have them split.
