# 2014-10-15 

Rebecca Treiman [requested](request.md) an update to a previously requested
report from Oct 20, 2012 (see original [README](README.orig.rst)).

At the time, many visits from sessions 11 and 12 had yet to be transcribed.
The new report contains word token counts for all Project 2 transcripts for
all transcripts from sessions 11 and 12.  It was generated using the same
python script used to create the previously requested report, except we
constrain to only report on transcripts from sessions 11 and 12.
