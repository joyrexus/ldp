.. admonition:: UPDATE

   11-20-2012: regenerated the report (``report.v3.xls``) as requested 
   so as to indicate the particular parent speaker.

The enclosed report contains word token counts for both child and parent
speakers at each home visit of the normally developing subjects (i.e., Project
2).  

The default tokenization method was used (e.g., clitics were not expanded, etc.).

I have another request, if you don’t mind. This is for the number of word tokens produced by the child and each of the mother and father at each of the home visits. We want to use this as a control variable in our analyses. I know that this measure has been used in a number of other papers, and so I’m thinking that you may already have a file showing this information. We are looking just at the P2 kids.
