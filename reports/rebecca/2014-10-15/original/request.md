We are now doing some analyses of letter-related talk that include data from home visits 11 and 12. Earlier, you had sent us word token counts for both child and parent speakers at each of the home visits for the normally developing subjects (Project 2). These were done using the default tokenization method, and they were broken down to show the numbers for each of parent and child.
 
In the counts that you sent us a couple of years ago, there were 0 values for a number of the home visits 11 and 12. I think it was because the data for some of those visits hadnâ€™t been transcribed yet. For some of the sessions where there was  a 0, we know now that the session did take place.
 
Would you mind rerunning the report for project 2 kids for sessions 11 and 12? That would be very helpful.
 
Thanks,
Becky
