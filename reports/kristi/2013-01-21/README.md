Subject: data structure and task data

I've attached two spreadsheets:

1. `td.tsv`:  this includes data for each typically-developing subject for Education years for mother or PCG, family income, Gender, PPVT raw scores at 05H, 08H, 11H, 4G_1, Woodcock-Johnson Word ID W scores at 3G_1 and 4G_1, Gates-MacGinitie Reading Comprehension extended scale score  (like W) scores at 3G_1 and 4G_1. 

2. `bi.tsv`:  this includes information on the data structure for the
   brain-injured subjects.  

I included visit information for 01H through 4G_3.  I did not project likely visits for 5th grade through 10th grade.  I did, however, project visits for currently enrolled kids through the 4G_3 visit.  The kids with a projected visit will have a visit_status of "0" but a projected_visit of "1" for the visits yet to be completed.   
    
Additionally,  I created a subject project of 3R to indicate the 10 kids who we will recruit to make up the "refreshed sample."  I gave these 10 kids subject IDs of 200 through 209.  After talking to Susan Levine I projected the following visit schedule for these 10 kids:

    2 kids enter at 3rd grade and go through 7th grade
    3 kids enter at 4th grade and go through 6th grade
    5 kids enter at 5th grade and go through 9th grade

These, of course can be adjusted to whatever is better for this sample.
